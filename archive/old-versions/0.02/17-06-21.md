# About Scott Cawthon's Retirement
June 17, 2021
---
A few years ago, Scott Cawthon, creator of the Five Nights at Freddy's series posted the following message on Steam:

![I'm getting too old for this. And when I retire someday, I'm going to want to sit down at a computer and play YOUR games, read YOUR stories, and watch YOUR videos. Don't fall in with the people who have already given up on themselves. You are tomorrow's next big thing. :)](ScottRetiresMessage.png)

Earlier today, seven years after his first trailer for FNaF 1, Scott has retired. The series will eventually be under new management and will continue to evolve as time passes.

We, at Elite Games, have mixed feelings about the situation. It's almost unanimous in our team that it is next to impossible to be mad at Scott. As far as we know, his way of thinking has always been humble when referring to the community, especially after FNaF World (thank you so much for the Update 2, by the way) and his goals now are only to spend more time with his family, make games for fun again and just live the rest of his life. He will still be watching out for us (which is both gratifying and devastating, a bittersweet feeling I'm sure most FNaF fans will recognize) and we are glad to have been able to be part of the whole ride.

This leaves us at an awkward position, however. Do we continue making this fangame? Do we move on to other projects?

We have decided that, even if it's just as a parting gift, we should finish this project. Hell, we might even buy Scott a GameBoy Advance and send a cartridge of this rom hack his way, who knows?

After finishing this, we will move on to bigger projects, possibly with other people. We'll try to become who he wanted us to be all those years ago: independent creators that will become tomorrow's next big thing.

We will make you proud, Scott. Thank you.
