# 0.02 ALPHA
We were still using [HexManiacAdvance](https://github.com/haven1433/HexManiacAdvance) to modify `Pokémon Fire Red (1.0, USA)` by this point, and our biggest challenge here was to change the player character's sprites on demand, in order to change protagonist on each night of "Follow Me".

I have none of the original files from this time, but I will eventually scrape the sprites for you.
