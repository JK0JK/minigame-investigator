We have tried to do progress recently. However, it is very difficult to implement the next big part of the project. It involves changing  the overworld sprite of the main character once there is a warp.

If you ever played (or watched anyone play) the FNaF minigames, you know they feature different characters, depending on what mingame/phase it is.

For example, the end-of-night minigames from FNaF 3 all happen in what is assumed to be a broken down version of the FNaF 1 location. The same map is shared throughout the five nights, always featuring another character that the player controls.

This means that, for us to be able to have the different stages of these minigames to work properly, we need a script that will tell the game to change the player's appearence to that of Bonnie when you play the second night's minigame or to Chica when you play the third night's one.

However, our efforts to make that script work have been in vain. We are still far from over with this project but it will take a long time before we are able to post any new updates. Some of our team members are also attending classes, so development is slow. We are sorry for the delay.

We have also been working on transposing a few music pieces from the FNaF games into the GBA system. We'll be glad to show you the results after the script is ready!

Thank you for your understanding.
