# 0.03 ALPHA
This is just about the time we decided to start using the decompilation project of `Pokémon Fire Red (1.0, USA)`. This is also the last version before the shift to Emerald.
Because we basically recompile the whole game from scratch, allocations of data are made automatically at compile time, so the patches get substantially larger in file size from here onward.

I have none of the original files from this time, but I will eventually scrape the sprites for you.
