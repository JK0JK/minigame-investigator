# 0.05 ALPHA
The final two versions of Minigame Investigator to be released to the public. After this, I started working on what was going to be called "The Identity Update", but unfortunately after some complications, that ended up not happening. Having that said, I made a backup midway through that I saved to my phone. Check out [0.06's README](../0.06/README.md) for more details.

I have none of the original files from this time, but this is just around the time when I had a [public repository](github.com/JK0JK/mi-emerald-deprecated) for all the changes, so some files may be found there.
