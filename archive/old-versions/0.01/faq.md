These are some basic questions and their basic answers. This list will be edited if other questions appear.

## 1. Who are you?
We are Elite Games, a small independent game developer team. We've worked on a few small games, though we never truly released them to the public. This project is going to be our first publicly available work.

## 2. What is the project?
The Minigame Investigator is a fan game based on Scott Cawthon's Five Nights at Freddy's. It is going to be a re-telling of the various 8-bit minigames presented throughout the series.

The game will only be playable with a Game Boy Advance emulator or with actual hardware, for a more nostalgic experience.

## 3. How will you make it compatible with the Game Boy Advance?
The game will be a modified version of Game Freak's Pokemon Emerald (though versions 0.01 Alpha and 0.02.5 Alpha are modified versions of Fire Red), since it is one of the easiest games to modify in the Game Boy Advance system, making it possible to play the game in the actual hardware. Modified versions of ROMs are known as Rom Hacks.

## 4. Is the game finished?
No. We are still working on it.

## 5. Does the Rom Hack contain lore?
[outdated response]

Yes! The game will be played through the eyes of a Fazbear Entertainment employee that starts to uncover the dark secrets of the company.  This interpretation is only to link the minigames together in one jumble of content and is not official by any means. This interpretation might be changed in the future if we come up with something more interesting.

## 6. Where can I download the latest build?
As of February 1st 2022, [the 0.05.23 Alpha build](../0.05.23/(v0.05.23%20ALPHA)%20Five%20Nights%20at%20Freddys%20-%20The%20Minigame%20Investigator.ups) is out! Keep in mind, however, that new features are being worked on and bugs (of which there are many) are being fixed.

## 7. Do you have any prior experience with Rom Hacking?
Unfortunately, no. One of us did change a few maps on his own and edited dialogue in the original Pokemon Red but never finished a project of this sort. That is also why you can expect development to be slower than that of another more experienced Rom Hacker.

## 8. Can I get in the team?
We are not employing outside help. However, if you want to contribute with music, sprites, ideas, theories, insights or other useful things, send a direct message to JK, the lead developer, on Twitter by clicking [here](https://twitter.com/JK0JK_)! If we do put your assets in the next build, you will be credited.

## 9. You suck at this.
Please do tell us what we are doing wrong! Our intention is to make this Rom Hack better and for that to happen we will need your feedback! Comment below or send a message to JK  on Twitter by clicking [here](https://twitter.com/JK0JK_)!
