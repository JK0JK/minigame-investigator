# 0.01 ALPHA
This is a very early point in the rom hack's life, when we were still doing binary hacking. By this point we were using tools like [HexManiacAdvance](https://github.com/haven1433/HexManiacAdvance) to modify `Pokémon Fire Red (1.0, USA)`.

I have none of the original files from this time, but I will scrape the sprites for you.
