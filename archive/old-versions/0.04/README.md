# 0.04 ALPHA
This is just about the time we decided to start using the decompilation project of `Pokémon Emerald (US)`.

I have none of the original files from this time, but this is just around the time when I had a [public repository](github.com/JK0JK/mi-emerald-deprecated) for all the changes, so some files may be found there.
