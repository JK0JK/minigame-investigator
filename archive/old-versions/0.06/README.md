# 0.06 ALPHA
After the "Pizzeria Update", I started working on what was going to be called "The Identity Update". The intention was to make an introductory cutscene, make custom sprites for the protagonists - male and female, and abandon the "Pokémon" branding.

Unfortunately after some complications, that ended up not happening and that's when the project got cancelled for good. Having that said, I made a backup midway through that I saved to my phone.

The [latest _working_ version]((v0.06.9.420%20ALPHA)%20Five%20Nights%20at%20Freddys%20-%20The%20Minigame%20Investigator.ups) dates from June 7th, 2022. I was also unable to recompile old broken versions, but you can try your luck getting them from the [public repository](github.com/JK0JK/mi-emerald-deprecated).
