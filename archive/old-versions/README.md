# Old Versions
This is an archive of the old versions of Minigame Investigator.
Since these were made _before_ the clean codebase, I can only provide the patches, no `.gba` files.
Having that said, you can see on [this table](#versions) what patch to apply to which ROM, what was added and what changed.

Don't just jump into the versions, however. Back in the day, Minigame Investigator a blog where updates would posted. The blog does not exist anymore, but
I preserved them all here.
The links in some of them may be dead (most notably the twitter page), but if you're going through the trouble of reading the archives you might also be interested in them.
If you just want the patches, however, skip to [this table](#versions).
